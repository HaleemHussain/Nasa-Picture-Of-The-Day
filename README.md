## Nasa A Picture Of The Day App

Welcome to my Laravel application. This app is to view the Nasa Picture of the day. You can also choose a date of which you wish to view the Nasa picture Of the day. If the date you select returns a video the app will display the video instead.

To get started clone this repository and run `composer install`. This will install the necessary dependencies for the application to run.

You can now run `php artisan serve` to view this app on your local machine.

Note: I have uploaded the .env file as there is no sensitive data contained in the file. The API key provided is the `DEMO_KEY` provided by NASA.
